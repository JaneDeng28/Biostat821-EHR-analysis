# Testing/Documentation

1. Add a suite of tests to your EHR library using the `pytest` framework, for all functions.

    Commit your code.

2. Add a `README.md` file with documentation for both user classes: end users and contributors.

    Include for end users:

    * setup/installation instructions, including information about the expected input file formats
    * API description
    * examples

    Additionally, include for contributors:

    * testing instructions

    Commit your README.

    **Keep the documentation and tests updated throughout the semester.**

3. Add a function that computes the age at first admission of any given patient. The function signature is up to you - make good choices.
    
    This is our first additional feature! Whenever you add a new feature:
    * You may choose to tweak how the data are parsed and structured.
    * Add tests covering it.
    * Update the documentation and tests accordingly.

    Commit your code and README.

_Note_: feel free to commit more often than is noted here... It's difficult to commit too often.
